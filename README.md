# Willow

Since I do not use social media, I needed a way to help me stay in touch with my friends, who are spread across the world.

Willow is a web application that helps me by providing reminders to get in touch with friends periodically. It also helps me store interactions I have had with these friends so that we can pick up the conversation where we left off last time.

Check it out at https://willowdb.net. Feel free to create an account and play around with its features.

A hat-tip to my friend [Neil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neilfern/) for having inspired this project.
